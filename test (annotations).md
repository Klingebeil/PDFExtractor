- This is a test comment on page 1

> With the rise of innovation and entrepreneurship as avenues for journalists to take in their search for journalistic work, we need to critically interrogate how these terms are understood. Various journalism institutions are pushing a particular understanding of journalism, and of what constitutes meaningful and innovative journalism. (p. 1)

> We show that one existing, and prevalent, understanding of innovation in journalism is one that is linear, rational and outcomeoriented. We challenge this understanding and draw on processoriented theories of innovation to introduce the concepts of eﬀectuation, improvisation and becoming as new lenses to reconsider these phenomena. (p. 1)

> In this paper, we review and reﬂect on prevalent ideas about entrepreneurship and innovation that are promoted in the ﬁeld. We furthermore couple this reﬂection to experiences gathered while participating in an accelerator process, a short “sprint” programme for rethinking and testing an innovative idea and its business model, organised by one of the main funds aimed at journalism innovation in the Netherlands. We show that one of the understandings of entrepreneurship and innovation that exists in the ﬁeld of journalism is one that is linear, rational, and outcomeoriented. This stands in stark contrast to more processoriented theories of innovation that stem from ﬁelds outside of journalism studies. (p. 2)

> We introduce the concepts of eﬀectuation, improvisation and becoming as alternative lenses to reconsider these phenomena (Nayak and Chia 2011; Barrett 1998; Sarasvathy 2001). In doing so, we argue that this processoriented approach reclaims the (becoming) journalist’s spontaneity from a predominantly topdown framing of innovation. A processoriented approach therefore allows for a more bottomup, experiential, understanding and analysis of journalistic innovation and entrepreneurship. (p. 2)

> One of the ﬁrst issues that we observe is how to deﬁne innovation within the ﬁeld of journalism. We can broadly deﬁne innovation in journalism as the process of not just an “invention” of a new value for journalism, but also the process of implementing this new value in a market or a social setting to make it sustainable (Storsul and Krumsvik 2013). (p. 2)

- Ich finde die Hervorhebung dieses Widerspruchs extrem interessant da diese Abgrenzung auch eine wichtige Rolle in de Research Note no. 1 spielt

> Deuze and Witschge (2020) underscore and challenge the strong normative conceptualisations of what is considered to be (proper) journalism. These normative conceptualisations limit the innovative potential of the ﬁeld as a whole. In fact, innovators and entrepreneurs can be conceived of as pioneers who push our understanding of what can be considered journalism (Hepp and Loosen 2019). (p. 3)

> After her own experiments with her journalistic idea, Soﬁe applied to and entered a journalism innovation grant process. It is this grant process that we here reﬂect on. (p. 3)

> We hone in on two particular elements: its problembased orientation and its insistence on critical testing of assumptions that underline the more productoriented nature of the accelerator process. We then propose a processoriented view of entrepreneurship, arguing that this better ﬁts (p. 3)

> the actual process of entrepreneurship than the perspective that seems to be the basis of the innovation grant, working from a ﬁxed and rational view on entrepreneurship. From this alternative view on entrepreneurship, we then consider entrepreneurship as wayﬁnding process, putting forth a more intuitive, improvisational conceptualisation of entrepreneurship teaching (p. 4)

- Klingt als wäre das Programm dem Media Lab relativ ähnlich

> The grant Soﬁe applied for aims to support grant applicants in their innovation endeavours; the grant agency teaches journalistic applicants to adopt a business mindset by means of a coaching “pressure cooker” programme. Here, the applicants are meant to be taught how to further develop their innovative ideas and successfully introduce new forms of journalistic work. The programme is part of the “innovation fund” overseen by the Dutch Stimulation Fund for Journalism (Stimuleringsfonds voor de Journalistiek (SVDJ)). The ﬁnal goal of the pressure cooker programme is to produce a business plan that serves as the basis of a grant application to be handed in to the board of the fund, which subsequently decides whether to provide a grant. The innovation grant therefore supports and stimulates the incubation phase, the phase in which new ideas are validated in the market (O’Reilly and Binns 2019). (p. 4)

- Wichtig für die Einordnung des Papers

> Soﬁe approached her innovative research project as a research experiment. Conducting such an active experiment is a way to look at the innovation process as a researcher, not by studying it, but by doing it yourself. (p. 4)

- Die Quellen sind hier denke ich spannend

> A variety of debates surround the intersection of entrepreneurship, innovation, and journalism (Cohen 2015; Deuze and Witschge 2020; Witschge and Harbers 2018; Singer 2016; Singer 2018; Mensing and Ryfe 2013). Entrepreneurial journalists are deemed to bring change and new ways to monetise journalistic output, as such answering to many a crisis. As pioneers (Hepp and Loosen 2019), they are seen as the saviours of the profession (Cohen 2015, 514). (p. 5)

> It is important to stay critical of the kind of entrepreneurship that is being taught. Reﬂecting on entrepreneurial accelerator teaching, Parkkari (2015) critically looks at how people are being moulded by what is popularly understood as “good entrepreneurship. There is a very particular “disciplining” nature to these entrepreneurial courses: The ideal way here is very structured, eﬃcient and rational: you start by presenting a problem you have identiﬁed, then proceed to tell your solution to this problem, then present that you already know who your customers will be and ﬁnally tell how you make money with your solution and tell it in the form of a clear business model. This rational and eﬃcient way of presenting your idea (and yourself) is done repeatedly during the program. (Parkkari 2015, 10) (p. 6)

> Entrepreneurship is undertheorised in journalism studies (Barnes and Scheepers 2018, 95). There is a tendency to take the concept of entrepreneurship for granted, whereas it is actually a contested topic with a variety of ways to understand the process that comes with entrepreneurial activities. (p. 7)

> The innovation fund of the SVDJ has two main criteria. First of all, the proposed project has to be a journalistic project. For the fund, this means that it somehow contributes to the way that Dutch citizens form (political) opinions. Second, a project that seeks funding from the innovation fund must be innovative. For the fund, this means that the project reaches a new market or target audience, that it develops a new service or product, smoothens out an existing journalistic process, or that it is a journalistic project with a new business model. 2 The innovation fund thus oﬀers people an opportunity to “innovate” in line with what the fund understands as “innovation. ” (p. 7)

> One of the ﬁrst lessons revolved around “ﬁnding the problem. There was a worksheet that was inspired by the notion of thinking about “solving problems. It, ﬁrst of all, included a “when, “I want to, and “so I can” section that had to be ﬁlled in from the perspective of the customer. Soﬁe and her partner had to redesign the idea to ﬁt this notion of ﬁxing someone’s problem that included a moment in time when someone had a need, what need she had, and what purpose that need served. (p. 8)

> Yet, the main motivation was not about selling people a solution to a problem. The idea for the installations was driven more by convictions about a greater good; about social values that cater to people’s curiosity about other places in the world, not necessarily because the installations were providing some instrumental solution to a private want or need. In entrepreneurship and thinking about making an idea proﬁtable, it is very important to consider the needs of the people that an idea aims to serve. But it is here that Soﬁe, as a makerresearcher, hit exactly upon this point of the contradiction between the social purpose that a journalistic enterprise wishes to serve and the need to make proﬁt from such work. (p. 9)

- Finde ich eine interessante Fragestellung

> Although we understand the value of gathering information about an entrepreneurial project, we wonder how this attitude of scepticism and “ignoring compliments” also staggers excited people to continue their work. (p. 10)

> To only focus on “how much money it will save a person” and disregard any other value the work can have, can diminish an innovative project, particularly a journalistic one. Journalism has always had an ambiguous relationship towards ﬁnding business models for its public mission. Rather than bringing in coaches that embodied this ambiguity, the coaches were largely from commercial backgrounds. (p. 10)

- Kenne ich. Die Frage ist natürlich ob das Projekt selbst ein guter fit war.

> After participating in the pressure cooker, decisions were made more rationally and aimed at a speciﬁc goal rather than looking at a next step in any kind of direction. In adopting a more critical mindset, Soﬁe had become somewhat sceptical of her own enthusiasm for what the installations could oﬀer. Although she was “successful” in obtaining a grant from the fund, she lost the passion for her work in the process. (p. 10)

> rightly or wrongly, journalists tend to view their distance from the economic realities of the news industry as both a mark and a guarantor of their editorial autonomy, and therefore of their ability to serve the public interest honestly and impartially. Such a normative stance may indeed retain its social value, but it presents obstacles that go beyond those any entrepreneur necessarily faces in turning an idea into a proﬁtable, sustainable business. (Singer 2016, 135) (p. 10)

> For Soﬁe, the reason to do the work she was doing was very personal. The ﬁre behind the project was one of passion, emotion, and a sense of needing to see this idea come to life. Although there were rational reasons for explaining why her project was worthwhile, these reasons did not instigate or drive it. (p. 11)

> Starting from this view, means we understand that people do not always need endgoals or plans to take coherent action (Chia 2017, 108). For entrepreneurs too, as entrepreneurship researcher Johannisson (2011, 136) found in his research, actions are hardly ever intentionally planned, but often rely on “irrationalities” such as passion, emotion and, improvisation. (p. 12)

> To understand organisations and how people cooperate with a form of excited energy we can take jazz as a metaphor. Barrett notices how musicians often establish a “groove” together: “It involves a shared “feel, for the rhythmic thrust. Once a group shares this (p. 12)

> common rhythm, it begins to assume a momentum, as if having a life of its own separate from the individual members” (Barrett 1998, 614). When establishing a groove, players often speak of a transcendent moment. It “seems to involve a surrender of familiar controlled processing modes; they speak of being so completely absorbed in playing that they are not consciously thinking, reﬂecting, or deciding on what notes to play” (Barrett 1998, 614). (p. 13)

> To understand this process, we can draw on the theory of theory of eﬀectuation (Sarasvathy 2001) which views entrepreneurship in terms of the improvisational, aﬀective character of entrepreneurial work. This theory positions “eﬀectuation” processes as opposite to “causation” processes. Causation, here, refers to a way of strategising towards realising an entrepreneurial ﬁrm by focusing on a very particular eﬀect and selecting the means to create that eﬀect, whereas eﬀectuation emphasises the possible means one has at one’s disposal and see what kind of eﬀects one can create with those means (Sarasvathy 2001, 245). Sarasvathy uses the example of cooking a meal, where a causation process might involve selecting a recipe and then collecting all the necessary ingredients, whereas eﬀectuation would be to look in one’s cupboards at what is available and then create a dish with what is at hand (Sarasvathy 2001, 245). The consequence is that “causation models consist of manyto-one mappings, eﬀectuation models involve oneto-many mappings” (Sarasvathy 2001, 245). (p. 13)

> Eﬀectuation leaves more room for slow growth, unpredictability, the unknowable, and takes into account how a general goal might be clear—the creation of a new ﬁrm—but that the way to achieve that goal is open to ambiguity (Nayak and Chia 2011, 302 discussing the work of Sarasvathy). Eﬀectuation also takes the individuals who are doing entrepreneurship and their particular motivations and set of means available to them more seriously, rather than focusing on a perspective of some omniscient observer (Nayak and Chia 2011, 302 discussing the work of Sarasvathy).
